## Description
This program was written to make generation of a team roster easier for a manager.  It prompts the manager for information about the employees they want to input and then stores that input in a structured, user-friendly format.  Each employee has their own profile with generated links that allow the Manager to quickly get information about each employee and email/review their Git Hub pages.

## Installation
1. VS Studio Code- https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Git Bash- https://git-scm.com/
3. Node.js- https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Initial package installs can be accomplished with "npm i".  This will download the following dev dependencies:

1. Inquirer.js Package- Used to generate question prompts.
2. Jest- Used to test that all the functionality in the program is working.

## Usage
Caption 1: Screen shot of repository framework.

Caption 2: Screen shot of JSON package with dependencies.

Video 1: Completing the prompts as a user and opening the HTML for view.

Video 2: Intiating testing.

## Testing Methods
1. Testing requires the JEST testing platform.
2. Testing can be intialized using the command "npm run tests".
3. Tests to be run will be in the _test_ folder.
	- These tests have been designed using JEST to check functionality on functions in each segment of the program. 
	- They also test the ability of the program to render the HTML correctly to the newly created team.html file.

## Road Map
Future Improvements:

1. Creating functionalty that allows the Manager to add another manager in addition to themselves.
2. Creating functionality that allows the Manager to input additional employee titles.
3. Creating functionality that allows the Manager to link to their Manger's team page.
4. Adding more information about each employee that can be submitted by the employee themselves.
